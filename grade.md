# Grade

All basic tests passed except for EndError, which seems to be stuck in some kind of loop, instead of recognizing the syntex error on the missing endif
token and exiting immediately. -10.

The tests with a comment on the same line as a print statement generated an unnecessary exception. -2 for each one.

All extra tests passed (including NestedIfElse).

Total:

136 / 100 (-14 for the basic tests)

Good work!
