# Project-3-Interpreter

*This is a complex and challenging project! Read the included feature descriptions carefully! Start early and ask questions!*

**Due Thursday, February 23 at 11:59 PM**

## Description and Grading

Finish the interpreter program we began in class. The code we developed together is included as a starting point. Use your own `Lexer` and `Token` classes from Project 2.

The basic features you **must** implement to receive full credit are described in `Project_3_Basic_Features.txt`. The list of extra features you **may** complete for **extra credit** are described in `Project_3_Extra_Features.txt`.

The `Test` directory contains two sets of test programs: the number of tests your interpreter successfully executes will determine your grade. Each of the ten `Basic` tests count for ten points each. Each of the `Extra` tests count for five points each.

## Partners

**If you choose, you may work with a partner to complete this assignment.**

You and your partner will submit the same code and receive the same grade.
